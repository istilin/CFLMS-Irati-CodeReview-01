					<h1>My story:</h1>
				
					<p>Hello there!</p>

					<p>I am a 31 year old girl coming from the Basque Country (or Baskenland in German). </p>

					<p>I've gone a long way to end up here. Wanna go for a ride? Tie your boots and let's go.</p>

					<p>Everything started in a small city called Vitoria-Gasteiz (unofficially the capital of the Basque Country although everyone thinks it's Bilbao :P), one of the Greenest cities in Europe (awarded Green Capital 2012, yes we are very proud of this). I lived there for 19 years, studied in a school called Abenda√±o and then moved to a High School called Mendebaldea. In my free time I enjoyed many different activities, such as music and sport:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Music:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Played the accordion until I was 11.</li>
							<li>Played the flute from 8 till 19.</li>
							<li> Learned music and got amazing grades.</li>
							<li>Played in a "Combo" jazz band.</li>
							<li>Played in different orchestras.</li>
							<li>Sang in a choir.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Sports</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Basque dances until I got bored.</li>
							<li>Swimming until I was bored.</li>
							<li>Judo until I was 11, because I broke my collarbone with my nose.</li>
							<li>Football until I was 16, because I was so bad I didn't feel comfortable anymore.</li>
							<li>Aerobic dancing, because yes, I am not so bad at dancing.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<p>At a very early age I developed an interest in science. I think I was around 5 when I wanted to become an astronaut (surprise surprise). During my highschool years I realised that is a very tough goal to achieve so I lowered my expectations and goals a little. I developed an interest in astronomy for a long time so I decided to study astronomy. Since that wasn't possible in Spain, I had to start studying physics in Bilbao, although I was more into maths.</p>

					<p>After my first year of University, I came across this astronomy camp called IAYC which was the beginning of one of my most important journeys in my life. There I got to learn a lot about research, astronomy, I improved my English, I became more social, I learned so much about different cultures, etc.</p>


					<p>After a couple of years of tears and pain at university, and when my motivation level wasn't at the greatest moment, I was in Tenerife on holidays with my parents, and we decided to visit the University there. We realised that I could change to Physics there and do some real astronomy subjects so within 2 weeks I was enrolled there and ready to move to the island! My life changed completely and my motivation level increased again!</p>

					<p>After some years of motivation going up and down I managed to finish my Licenciatura (Bachelor + Masters) in Physics and ready to enrol for the Masters. What could possibly go wrong? Curriculum changes due to Bologna? The Erasmus year where I couldn't take any extra exams? maybe... But I was ready, because thanks to the IAYC I got enough motivation during the summer to get energy for the whole year (which I helped organise for 6-7 years, and it gave me the oportunity to gain many many skills).</p>

					<p>So yeah, I finished my Masters (last year in my hometown while remotely doing my master proyect in Solar Physics) and yeah, everything took longer than expected, but I was ready to look for a PhD and start my academic career.</p>

					<p>I also enjoyed life, I made a bazillion of friends, both in Tenerife and at camp, as well as in my hometown. I learned to play the guitar on my own, I learned lindy hop dancing, I joined a few different choirs, so I did get to enjoy learning new different things.</p>

					<p>Then the oportunity came, it was September, in Greece, on a tour around the country, with a lot of 60 year old people on the bus. I got the call that I was accepted in a PhD program in Vienna! That was probably one of the best days of my life, or was it? Because I had no idea what I was getting myself into...</p>

					<p>The summary is, I wasn't made for the academic world. I spent 2 years and a half doing my PhD, and I lost my complete motivation (and self-esteem) working on a project that had no goal and I couldn't see any future in it. In a world that prepares you to write, and write, and write papers before you even find results. Where competition is predomimant over collaborations. And this was inmensely crashing with the person I am, with the person I wanted to be. Although I am person who never abandons goals and dreams, I had to make the difficult decission to quit and find something different for myself. And after spending a year and a few months unnemployed (learning German, because why not, I live in Austria), I found my next opportunity with the CodeFactory. I love learning, I love coding, and I also love teaching. So... Why not? I didn't expect such a great chance for me in my whole life. </p>

					<p>I am finally looking forward to the future. :)</p>
